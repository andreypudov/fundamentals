            Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple
            sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares
            adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
            The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
            The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way
            smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

             The implementation introduces a flag variable to stop the bubble sort
             as soon as it becomes sorted.

            <summary>
            Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort can be
            thought of as an improved selection sort: like selection sort,
            heapsort divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and
            it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest
            element from it and inserting it into the sorted region. Unlike
            selection sort, heapsort does not waste time with a linear-time scan
            of the unsorted region; rather, heap sort maintains the unsorted
            region in a heap data structure to more quickly find the largest
            element in each step.

            Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final
            sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient
            on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort,
            heapsort, or merge sort.

            <summary>
            In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is
            an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm.
            Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order
            of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is
            a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann
            in 1945. A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort
            appeared in a report by Goldstine and von Neumann as early as 1948.

            <summary>
            Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting
            a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements
            into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or
            greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

            Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids
            comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets
            according to their radix.

            <summary>
            Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has
            an O(n2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists,
            and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.
